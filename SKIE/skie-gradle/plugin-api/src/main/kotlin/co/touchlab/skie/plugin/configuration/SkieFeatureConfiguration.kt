     * Warning: Depending on the project this action can have a significant impact the compilation time because it turns off the Kotlin compiler caching.
     *
     * Note that even with this property turned on, it is still required to enable default arguments for individual functions from those libraries.
     * This can be done only via the group configuration from Gradle.
     * To opt in for some functions, use `group("$declarationFqNamePrefix") { DefaultArgumentInterop.Enabled(true) }`.
     * To opt in for all functions globally, use `group { DefaultArgumentInterop.Enabled(true) }`.

    /**
     * SKIE has a **preview** support for converting `suspend` functions into `Combine.Future` types.
     * When enabled,
     * SKIE will extend `Combine.Future` with an initializer accepting any `async` lambda.
     *
     * With it, you can easily convert any `suspend` function into `Combine.Future`.
     * Let's take a look at an example usage. We'll declare a suspending global function `helloWorld`.
     *
     * ```kotlin
     * suspend fun helloWorld(): String {
     *     return "Hello World!"
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * Then in Swift you can use the new `Future` initializer like so:
     *
     * ```swift
     * let future = Future(async: helloWorld)
     *
     * future.sink { error in
     *     // Handle an error throw by the function.
     *     // Note that this could also be `CancellationError`.
     * } receiveValue: { value in
     *     // Value is a `String` "Hello World!"
     *     print(value)
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * NOTE: It's important to understand how Combine and its operators work.
     *       The example above doesn't store the cancellable returned by `sink`,
     *       so it would immediately cancel and `receiveValue` wouldn't get called.
     *       Additionally, Futures are hot and will invoke the provided `async` immediately.
     *       This means Futures don't wait for calling `.sink` on them.
     *       Futures also don't support cancellation.

     * SKIE has a **preview** support for converting Flows into `Combine.Publisher` types.
     * When enabled,
     * each Flow bridged to Swift by SKIE will contain a `toPublisher()` method.
     *
     * Use this if you need to interface with *Combine* code and can't use Swift's native `AsyncSequence`.
     * Let's take a look at an example usage. We'll declare a global function `helloWorld` returning a `Flow`.
     *
     * ```kotlin
     * fun helloWorld(): Flow<String> {
     *     return flow {
     *         emit("Hello")
     *         delay(1.seconds)
     *         emit("World")
     *         delay(1.seconds)
     *         emit("!")
     *     }
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * Then in Swift you can use the `toPublisher()` function.
     *
     * ```swift
     * let publisher = helloWorld().toPublisher()
     *
     * publisher.sink { value in
     *     // Value is a `String` type
     *     // Receives with a 1-second delay between them:
     *     // - "Hello"
     *     // - "World"
     *     // - "!"
     * }
     * ```

     * NOTE: It's important to understand how Combine and its operators work.

    /**
     * SKIE has a **preview** support for observing Flows in SwiftUI views.
     * When enabled,
     * SKIE will include two APIs for observing Flows in SwiftUI.
     * Each has its own uses, and we'd like your feedback on both.
     *
     * The first one is a view modifier `collect`,
     * which you can use to collect a flow inside a view.
     * Either into a `@State` property directly using a SwiftUI `Binding`,
     * or through a provided `async` closure.
     *
     * The other one is a SwiftUI view `Observing`,
     * which you can use to collect one or multiple flows and display a view based on the latest values.
     * This is similar to the builtin SwiftUI view `ForEach`.
     * Where `ForEach` takes a synchronous sequence (e.g. an array),
     * `Observing` takes an asynchronous sequence (e.g. a Flow, a SharedFlow, or a StateFlow).
     *
     * Let's consider the following Kotlin view model which we'll want to interact with from SwiftUI.
     *
     * ```kotlin
     * class SharedViewModel {
     *     val counter = flow<Int> {
     *         var counter = 0
     *         while (true) {
     *             emit(counter++)
     *             delay(1.seconds)
     *         }
     *     }
     *
     *     val toggle = flow<Boolean> {
     *         var toggle = false
     *         while (true) {
     *             emit(toggle)
     *             toggle = !toggle
     *             delay(1.seconds)
     *         }
     *     }
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * Then we can use the SKIE-included helpers to interact with the `SharedViewModel` from SwiftUI.
     * In the sample below, we'll use all of them as an example, not a real-world scenario.
     *
     * ```swift
     * struct ExampleView: View {
     *     let viewModel = SharedViewModel()
     *
     *     @State
     *     var boundCounter: KotlinInt = 0
     *
     *     @State
     *     var manuallyUpdatedCounter: Int = 0
     *
     *     var body: some View {
     *         Text("Bound counter using Binding: \(boundCounter)")
     *             .collect(flow: viewModel.counter, into: $counter)
     *
     *         Text("Manually updated counter: \(manuallyUpdatedCounter)")
     *             .collect(flow: viewModel.counter) { latestValue in
     *                 manuallyUpdatedCounter = latestValue.intValue
     *             }
     *
     *         Observing(viewModel.counter, viewModel.toggle) {
     *             ProgressView("Waiting for counters to flows to produce a first value")
     *         } content: { counter, toggle in
     *             Text("Counter: \(counter), Toggle: \(toggle)")
     *         }
     *
     *         Observing(viewModel.counter.withInitialValue(0), viewModel.toggle.withInitialValue(false)) { counter, toggle in
     *             Text("Counter: \(counter), Toggle: \(toggle)")
     *         }
     *     }
     * }
     * ```
